<h2 id="description-vitamin-a">Description vitamin A</h2>
<p>Vitamin A is a group of fat-soluble substances that are found in animal products. These substances include retinol (an alcohol) and retinal (an aldehyde). Retinal is responsible for production of an acid that affects gene transcription. By means of cellular differentiation, physiological roles of cells are specialized. Vitamin A also includes carotenoids, which are produced by plants. These are transformed to retinal. Fruits and vegetables for example contain beta-carotene, which is converted to vitamin A in the human body.</p>
